                Sister, you are a guardian angel in disguise.<br>
You are perceptive, intelligent, and wise,<br>
Always helping me through good and bad.<br>
You are also the greatest friend I've ever had.<br>
If I could have one wish, it would be<br>
To give you all that you have given to me.<br>
Though I've put our relationship through some hazy days,<br>
You've been the sunlight that has shone in so many ways.<br>
Through my ups and downs, right by me you stood,<br>
And you gave me your hand whenever you could.<br>
Though I am sure my mistakes will not end here,<br>
You're always there to keep me away from my fears.<br>
I don't doubt some of your headaches are from me.<br>
With all the times you lecture and tease,<br>
I stand there upset and displeased.<br>
Though I tell you I can't stand you,<br>
You come back with, "That's not true."<br>
We've had our fights,<br>
Which lead to sleepless nights,<br>
But in the end, I thank you so much.<br>
My appreciation for you has no end.<br>
You will always be my sister and my friend.<br>

Still as the wind on a hot summer's day,<br>
Still as your friendship I'll never betray,<br>
Still as the characters in a photograph,<br>
Still as your breathless, silent laugh.<br><br>

Within you, I've found the perfect friend,<br>
A mind that I can comprehend,<br>
A person I see is so much like me,<br>
A mutual relationship so carefree.<br><br>

Carefree as a child who questions the world,<br>
Carefree as a scream that goes unheard,<br>
Carefree as an adult blessed with a dream,<br>
Carefree as water flowing downstream.<br>

                You're growing to become the intelligent woman I know you can be.<br>

                I wish you the best in life, though we both know how hard it can be,<br>

                You are the kind of person who always offers a helping hand.<br>
                We are miles away from each other, but the love we share will never end.<br>
                Never seeing you again will always be a difficult test,<br>

Who will be there to fight your fears?<br>

There are people whom you can't replace,<br>

                A family is like a circle.<br>

                Families are those who help,<br>

                A family is like a book.<br>
                The ending's never clear,<br>
                but through the pages of the book,<br>
their love is always near.<br><br>

A family is many things.<br>
With endless words that show<br>
who they are and what they do<br>
and how they teach you so you know.<br>

Our lives were just beginning.<br>
Your love for us never failed,<br>
Our hearts continually mending.<br><br>

It is strange to watch the time fly<br>
Before our very eyes,<br>
Which reminds me of the blessing,<br>
That we have you in our lives.<br><br>

To have yet to feel the touch<br>
That's as gentle as your hand<br>
The closeness of our family<br>
One could never understand.<br><br>

As each of our lives,<br>
Continues to change,,<br>
Reflections of your love<br>
In each of us remains.<br>

My father.<br><br>

When scuffed up knees made me cry,<br>
Soft hankies wiped my sad eyes dry,<br>
Coaxing me each time I tried.<br>
You were always there,<br>
My mother.<br><br>

Who held my hand when I was scared?<br>
Ate candy that he should have shared?<br>
The things I did because you dared,<br>
My brother.<br>

                The love of this family can show the work of God<br>
To prevail over our weakest of moments<br>
To lend a hand or mend a broken heart.<br><br>

To cry or laugh with one another shall always be,<br>
Embraced with open arms and a smiling face.<br><br>

Times they are tough, but alone you will never be<br>
To have the love of this family<br>
It's as easy as one, two, three.<br><br>

The joy of a birth, to watch a little life grow<br>
Are memories to cherish that we will never let go<br><br>

The pain of a death, the emptiness felt inside,<br>
The family is all here, no need to hide<br>
