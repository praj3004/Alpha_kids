                Of cloudless climes and starry skies;<br>
                And all that‚Äôs best of dark and bright<br>

                Thus mellowed to that tender light<br>
                Which heaven to gaudy day denies.
                <br><br>
                One shade the more, one ray the less,<br>
                Had half impaired the nameless grace<br>
                Which waves in every raven tress,<br>
                Or softly lightens o‚Äôer her face;<br>
                Where thoughts serenely sweet express<br>
                How pure, how dear their dwelling place.<br><br>

                And on that cheek, and o‚Äôer that brow,<br>
                So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,<br>
                The smiles that win, the tints that glow,<br>
                But tell of days in goodness spent,<br>
                A mind at peace with all below,<br>
                A heart whose love is innocent!<br>

                I don't know when it started,<br>
Or how it all began,<br>
But God created families,<br>
As only our Lord can.<br><br>

He was teaching what it means<br>
To love, honor, and obey.<br>
He wanted a strong bond<br>
That we don't see too much today.<br><br>

He wanted someone to hold us<br>
And show respect for others.<br>
He wanted someone who'd be gentle,<br>
So he created mothers.<br><br>

He wanted someone strong,<br>
A support filled with love,<br>
So he created fathers,<br>
Sent from heaven up above.<br>

I cried every night.<br>
A million tears fell,<br>
Still my heart wasn't right.<br><br>

While you weren't here<br>
I did what I could,<br>
Hoping against hope<br>
My decisions were good.<br>

While you weren't here<br>
I gained some in age.<br>
Things just went on<br>
And life turned a page.<br>
<br>
While you weren't here,<br>
I just tried to go on,<br>
Knowing what didn't kill me<br>
Would only make me strong.<br><br>

While you weren't here<br>
A whole lot got changed.<br>
My life became different,<br>
My world rearranged.<br>

                God gave each of us a special family<br>

Family is<br>
understanding, never demanding,<br>
all for one and one for all.<br>
I will never leave you alone standing.<br><br>

Family is<br>
one in itself; my love is your love.<br>
Your pain is my pain, my wealth is your wealth.<br>
I promise to never leave you by yourself.<br><br>

Family is<br>
the strongest team, the strongest unit.<br>
If love could be visualized,<br>
family would be the blueprint.<br>

            <div class="poem-text" id="poem-text6">
                The blessings of a big family<br>
are only seen by a few,<br>
A few of the chosen ones<br>
that God has given this blessing to<br><br>

The blessings are so numerous<br>
it's hard to even start<br>
to number or to name them but<br>
they all hold a place in the heart<br><br>

The heart of every person in a<br>
big family is unique<br>
its uniqueness makes us special<br>
and should not be critiqued<br>
<br>
The memories that are made<br>
are more precious than gold<br>
from babies to weddings<br>
from young and to old<br>

                When you feel like breaking down or crashing in,<br>
Who do you turn to, to forgive your sin?<br>
When you cried your lonely tears,<br>
Who will be there to fight your fears?<br>
And when it feels like no one would understand,<br>
Who was there to hold your hand?<br><br>

There are people whom you can't replace,<br>
They're the ones who gave you your face.<br>
They'll love you through thick and thin,<br>
They show you the light from deep within.<br>
And if by chance you happen to die,<br>
They'll be the ones who will really cry.<br>

                A family is like a circle.<br>
                The connection never ends,<br>
                and even if at times it breaks,<br>
                in time it always mends.<br><br>

                A family is like the stars.<br>
                Somehow they're always there.<br>
                Families are those who help,<br>
                who support and always care.<br>

                A family is like a book.<br>
                The ending's never clear,<br>
                but through the pages of the book,<br>
their love is always near.<br><br>

A family is many things.<br>
With endless words that show<br>
who they are and what they do<br>
and how they teach you so you know.<br>

Your love for us never failed,<br>
Our hearts continually mending.<br><br>

It is strange to watch the time fly<br>
Before our very eyes,<br>
Which reminds me of the blessing,<br>
That we have you in our lives.<br><br>

To have yet to feel the touch<br>
That's as gentle as your hand<br>
The closeness of our family<br>
One could never understand.<br><br>

As each of our lives,<br>
Continues to change,,<br>
Reflections of your love<br>
In each of us remains.<br>

My father.<br><br>

When scuffed up knees made me cry,<br>
Soft hankies wiped my sad eyes dry,<br>
Coaxing me each time I tried.<br>
You were always there,<br>
My mother.<br><br>

Ate candy that he should have shared?<br>
The things I did because you dared,<br>

To lend a hand or mend a broken heart.<br><br>

To cry or laugh with one another shall always be,<br>
Embraced with open arms and a smiling face.<br><br>

Times they are tough, but alone you will never be<br>
To have the love of this family<br>
It's as easy as one, two, three.<br><br>

The joy of a birth, to watch a little life grow<br>
Are memories to cherish that we will never let go<br><br>

The pain of a death, the emptiness felt inside,<br>
The family is all here, no need to hide<br>
